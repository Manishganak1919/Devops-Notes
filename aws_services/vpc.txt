                 VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD (VPC)
________________________________________________________________

VPC is our private cloud within AWS public cloud.
It is an isolated, customizable network within AWS,
where you can manage and create your own resources and services.

________________________________________________________________
                 COMPONENTS OF VPC
________________________________________________________________

1. Internet Gateway (IG)
2. Route Table
3. Subnets
4. NACLs (Network Access Control Lists)
5. Security Groups
6. NAT Gateway (Network Address Translation)

________________________________________________________________
                 INTERNET GATEWAY (IG)
________________________________________________________________

- Allows communication between your VPC and the Internet.
- If a VPC does not have an IG, resources in the VPC cannot be accessed from the Internet.
- Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
- IG is not Availability Zone specific.

________________________________________________________________
                 NAT GATEWAY (Network Address Translation)
________________________________________________________________

- Used for private subnets; by default, it allows only outbound traffic.
- EC2 instances (or other resources) inside a private subnet 
  can send traffic to the Internet (e.g., downloading updates or calling public APIs), 
  but the Internet cannot directly access those instances.
- Supports protocols like TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
- Each NAT Gateway is created in a specific Availability Zone.
